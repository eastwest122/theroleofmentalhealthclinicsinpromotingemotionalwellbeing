  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">
  <h3>Q1: What is the difference between therapy and counseling?
</h3>
  <p>A1: Therapy (or psychotherapy) typically involves deeper, long-term emotional work, exploring underlying patterns, trauma, or longstanding psychological dynamics. Counseling is often more short-term and goal-oriented, focusing on pragmatic issues, life transitions, or specific challenges. At New U Therapy Center & Family Services, we provide both — counseling for immediate support and therapy for deeper, sustained change.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">
  <h3>Q2: Can I see a psychiatrist online through a mental health clinic?
</h3>
  <p>A2: Yes. With telehealth advancements, many mental health clinics now offer telehealth psychiatrist services or online psychiatrist care. You can receive psychiatric evaluation, medication management, and follow-ups virtually from a licensed professional, often with the same standard of care as in-person visits. At our clinic, we offer both physical and virtual psychiatric care options to best suit your needs.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">
  <h3>Q3: How do I find an affordable mental health clinic near me?
</h3>
  <p>A3: Here are practical tips:

Search for clinics in your city or zip code (e.g. “mental health clinic near me” or “best mental health clinic in Camarillo”)

Look for sliding scale fees or income-based payment options

See whether the clinic accepts your insurance

Check if they provide telehealth (which lowers costs)

Ask about short-term or focused programs rather than open-ended therapy

Look for clinics affiliated with nonprofits, universities, or community health networks

New U Therapy Center & Family Services strives to meet all these criteria — offering affordability, insurance support, telehealth, and a comprehensive scope of care for Camarillo and surrounding areas.</p>
